Branch Naming Convention

Introduction
This document outlines the branch naming convention for our project. Following a consistent branch naming convention helps us better organize and manage our codebase. Please adhere to the rules and guidelines specified below when creating and naming branches.

Branch Types
Feature Branches (feature):
Used to work on a specific feature or issue.
The branch name should follow the format: feature-<issue_number>-<author_name>-<short_description>.
Example: feature-3-Alice-Add-User-Auth

Bug Fix Branches (bug):
Used to address and fix bugs or issues.
The branch name should follow the format: bug-<issue_number>-<author_name>-<short_description>.
Example: bug-15-Bob-Fix-Navigation-Bug

Update Branches (update):
Used to address updates in the production environment.
The branch name should follow the format: update-<issue_number>-<author_name>-<short_description>.
Example: update-101-David-Updated-Navbar


Guidelines

1. Keep branch names concise and descriptive. Avoid long branch names.
2. Use lowercase letters for branch names.
3. Separate words in the branch name with hyphens (-) for readability.
4. Always include the issue number, author's name, and a short, meaningful description.
5. Use the appropriate branch type prefix (e.g., feature, bug, fix) to indicate the purpose of the branch.
6. Collaborate and communicate with your team to ensure everyone understands and follows the naming convention.

Example Branch Names
Feature Branch: feature-3-Alice-Add-User-Auth
Bug Fix Branch: bug-15-Bob-Fix-Navigation-Bug
Update Branch: update-101-David-Updated-Navbar


Conclusion
Consistently following this branch naming convention will improve codebase organization, enhance collaboration, and simplify branch tracking. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our project remains well-maintained and organized.
